Lab 3 Notes:

OSCR - 3.25MHz - COunter register.
OSMR - ex: 3.25 million

(Match Register)
		whenever OSCR matches Match register, interrupt to update
		In example, with the osmr set to this value, OSMR, interrupt every second.
		With this interrupt, handling time and sleep syscalls will be easy.

(The two registers)
	These two are memory mapped registers.
	reg.h -> utility functions for reading writing etc. 
		(volatile handling accounted for in reg.h)

	Will only need one match register (only need single interrupt in the system)
	Use reg_set to enable certain register. 

	Handling interrupts will differ (cannot disable IRQ, FIQ mode as done in the past)
